Quarzia combines traditional batik craftsmanship with contemporary European design, offering a unique, timeless collection of handmade silk garments.

Born from a desire for quality and style, each piece is meticulously crafted by local Balinese artisans, making it one-of-a-kind.

The brand's collection includes kimonos, kaftans, dresses, pants, jumpsuits, skirts, tops, and sarongs, all embodying relaxed elegance and luxurious style.

Quarzia is not just about clothing; it's an invitation to feel unique and special, adding a touch of seductive, informal elegance to everyday outfits.
