Davina Stephens' website project started from First Principles as a brand new blank sheet.

### First Meeting


Pencil and paper, we annotated the desired, the imagined goals, the needs, the expectations.

We listed what she expected the website to accomplish.

The works, the collections, the styles, the significance.
And here we are off topic into philosophy, meta-communication, and the meeting is over.

Glasses, once full with freshly blended tropical fruit of the season, lay empty on the poolside table.


### Follow up

Digested that laundry lists. Rokma built a proposal plan. Think pimp-you-car improvements on the client original idea and expectations.

Aim high, straight to the top, then adjust as needed.
Motivational narratives do wonders.

###  Result

We built a small system for Davina to first track her artworks, then showcase the selected pieces, on the web.

A bit of logic, a Shared Google Sheet and a fast, clean, slick website.
Boom!  Each artwork has its own page/URL so it's easy to share a particular piece.

Just copy the URL and paste it into any social media. A bit of ordinary magic and the link turns into a card with thumbnail image, title and subtitle and excerpt.

The artist now dispose of an archiving tool to keep track of her whole production, history, presentation, copy, grouping. Any changes can be easily rolled back. There is repo for that. It's even open source.

She can now edit titles, text, collections, tags... A streamlined tag logic distributes the artist works into the various pages and sections of the website

The minimalist website look, colour and visual impact, withdraws to a dim level, almost absent, to stage the content protagonist.

The website also disposes of all the necessary presentational tools for the  artist PR needs. Biography, Artist Statement, QR codes, BIZ cards.
