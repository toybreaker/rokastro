Probably the first video on the Italian skate/snowboarding scene.

A year long filming, with the Freezer Magazine crew.
All over the southern side of the Alps.

Do or die!
All about high energy fun, action and frugality.

Yeah, filming and producing VHS-tapes.
Analog inline editing, crazy working.

As precious experience as darkroom photography is,
probably useless today,
right?!
