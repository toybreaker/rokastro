## Freezer Snowmag

Probably the first video on the Italian skate/snowboarding scene.

A year long filming, with the [FREEZER MAGAZINE](https://freezer.junglestar.org) crew.
All over the southern side of the Alps.

Do or die!
All about high energy fun, action and frugality.

Yeah, filming and producing VHS-tapes.
Analog inline editing, crazy working.

As precious experience as darkroom photography is,
probably useless today, right?!

[1996]

## Munster Juice

Skateboarding World Master Contest. One of the first International skateboarding contest. An annual skaters gathering organised by Titus Dittman in Germany.

Filmed on analog Hi8 tapes and self postproduced via inline editing. Sold worldwide via VHS tapes.

[1993]
