27 free issues.

Freezer Magazine, Rokma's brainchild, came as a striking lightning over a stagnant industry.

It created its own distribution.

> The player voice showing what's up in the streets and parties.

Shortly, low fidelity newsstand media were left with few readers.

> We retired FREEZER, sipping on fresh coconuts, no straw needed, the 31st December 2000. Freezer has probably peaked the free-press era, and the adv-sustained, triangular cashflow biz model printed-media has since faded away in the internet times.

In 2023 there is still no magazine in Italy with a significant advertiser list like freezer's one: Nike, Swatch, Sprite, Benetton, Diesel, v2 Records, Polygram, Burton, Quiksilver, Billabong, Freshjive, Carhartt, Arnette, O'Neil, Mambo, Oakley, Luxottica, Cat, Etnies, L'Oreal, Vans, DCshoes, Gravis, Dickies, Meltin Pot, Bastard, Fornarina...
